# Dev Advent Calendar 🎅 Puzzle 13 - Number Conversion 🏛️

For hundreds of years, the elves have been working with roman numerals. They use it everywhere - in file cabinets, in notes, etc.
This was okay when the numbers were smaller. But some index cards sure are getting big, and the roman version of reading it is just not practical anymore.

Therefore once again the head elf 🧝 counts on your help.

## 🧩 The puzzle

Complete the function `romanToArabic` in [src/utils/roman.js](src/utils/roman.js).

The parameter `input` is a string of roman numerals, either in lower- or uppercase (e.g. `CXXIII` or `cxxiii`).

Return the arabic number for a given roman number.

You can assume the numbers will be between `1` and `99999`.
