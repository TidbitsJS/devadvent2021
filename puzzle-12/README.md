# Dev Advent Calendar 🎅 Puzzle 12 - Xmas Tree Art 🎄

> This puzzle will be less a puzzle and more a challenge. It will be different from the JavaScript puzzles before 😉

The elves are having a little competition about who makes the most beautiful art about a Christmas tree, and since you've been helping them out a great deal lately, they invited you to participate.

## 💪 The challenge

**Create a representation of a Christmas tree with CSS.**

In the file [index.html](index.html) you can find the HTML structure for the tree. It' absolutely valid to add more elements to the markup.
Write your CSS code in [style.css](style.css).

### Rules

-   Don't just copy entire projects from the Internet
-   Don't just load an image. Make the tree with CSS!
