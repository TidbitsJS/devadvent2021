# ðŸŽ… Dev Advent Calendar 2021

The **Dev Advent Calendar** is an initiative by [@themarcba](https://twitter.com/themarcba) in order to give back to the community and learn something on the way.

For every day from the **1st to the 24th of December**, an Xmas-themed coding puzzle is given as a repository to solve.

This repository contains the respective valid solutions for all the puzzles.

## Day 1

Weeks before Christmas, Santa's reindeers start practicing their flying in order to be fit for the big night. Unfortunately, one of them (Rudolf) crashed and landed in the forest ðŸŒ²

Now, Santa ðŸŽ… needs YOUR help to find him.

## Day 2

The Elf Coffee Shop has its big reopening after lengthy renovation works during the summer. Not only is it completely modernized, but has also a whole new range of available drinks. In the old coffee shop, the elves could only choose between "Hot Chocolate" and "Coffee". This new coffee shop has a list of various drinks (e.g. Latte, Hot Chocolate, etc.) and optional flavors (e.g. Gingerbread, Peppermint, etc.).

Since this is new and confusing to the elves, especially because the pricing is a bit more complicated than before, the owner of Elf Coffee Shop asked if you could create an automated menu. He would provide you with the name/price of each drink, and the name/price of each available flavor.

It now is your job to create a list of all possible combinations of these drinks (including those without extra flavor), and the pricing.

## Day 3

[Yesterday's puzzle](./puzzle-2) was about creating the menu for the Elf Coffee Shop. The owner was very satisfied with the result.

Due to the high demand, the savy entrepreneur hired someone to make an app where elves can order their drink, and it would be delivered home, or to their workplace.

The only thing missing is a REST API to get the drinks.
It is your job to populate the API with the correct data, so it can be consumed by the app.

## Day 4

You might not know this, but the Elf Post Service ðŸ“¯ (ECS) is the largest parcel organization in the world. (For obvious reasons though, now that you think about, right?). They are ecologically responsible, so they continuously try to make everything more efficient, also when sending out packages.

That's why they introduced some new box sizes, in order to waste less paper/carton. Before, there were only 3 sizes (S, M, L), now there is a selection of 7 different sizes. This makes it not always that obvious which package is right for which item.

Santa himself asked for your help to develop an algorithm that can select the smallest possible box (but big enough for the item to fit) for any given item.
